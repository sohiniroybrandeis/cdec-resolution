It was among the least surprising political events so far this year, but Vladimir Putin's reelection to a fifth term in office—where he secured an 87% landslide victory according to electoral authorities—comes at a time of geopolitical and economic uncertainty for Russia, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and international sanctions, prompting questions as to what we can expect from another six years of the Russian strongman's leadership, particularly regarding strategies in the Ukraine conflict, domestic economic reforms, and potential government reshuffles.	15	15	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	As expected , Russian President Vladimir Putin has won his fifth term in office, following a campaign marked by severe repression where all his significant rivals, including the late anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny who died while serving a 19-year sentence, were barred from running , imprisoned , or dead.	8	8	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	1

As people waited for hours in the German capital, Berlin, to cast their ballots Sunday in an election where Putin faces no real opposition en route to a fifth presidential term, Russia’s vast ideological divisions were on full display.	17	17	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	During the speech , which read like an election manifesto, the president flagged $126 billion in infrastructure and social spending over the next six years.	8	8	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	1
